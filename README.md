### Bugs

#### Solved Bugs

* When I deployed my project to GitHUb Pages I discovered my projecet's favicon was not not showing as website icon.
* I discovered this was because I had absolute file path such as thi in my code:

      <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/assets/images/favicon.png" style="border-radius:50%;">

* Removing the starting / fixed the problem.
